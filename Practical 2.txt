Creating new venv named de-venv
Updating de-venv
Installing jupyter kernel into de-venv
Installing numpy and pyspark into de-venv
  DEPRECATION: Building 'pyspark' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'pyspark'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334
Installing kernel de-venv to Jupyter Lab
Installed kernelspec de-venv in /home/student/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/de-venv
New venv de-venv created and installed. Please refresh your Jupyter Lab.
